      <p>Welcome to Byte me, where community meets sustainability. We’re on a mission to tackle hunger, reduce waste,
        and
        bring neighborhoods together. By connecting those in need with surplus food from local restaurants and grocery
        stores, we’re creating a more connected and sustainable world—one meal at a time.</p>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        As students and low-income households face rising food costs, we recognized the huge amount of perfectly edible
        food
        being discarded daily by local restaurants and grocery stores. We wanted to change that. Our journey started
        with
        a
        vision to create a platform that links excess food with those who need it most—without waste. Today, Byte me
        connects communities and businesses through a unique system that redistributes surplus food in real time.
